# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

**The Protagonist chair**
- `--position "<text>"` stages the user's own position: a `psychodrama-champion` agent defends it
  thesis by thesis (+1 call) and must name its `WEAK_POINT:`; voters stress-test it; the Judge
  reports `PROTAGONIST: survived | survived with conditions | did not survive`.
- Triage offers the chair when the question states a stance ("I want to", "we decided", …);
  `--no-position` suppresses the offer. Panel mode only.
- Skeptic receives an anchoring guard when a Champion is on stage.

**Role reversal — `STEELMAN:` in round 2**
- Every re-vote must first state the strongest version of the opposing position. A re-vote
  without it is invalid. Zero extra calls.

**Spectator mode — `--spectator`**
- The Judge appends a `## Match report`: per-thesis hits citing real tags, who flipped and after
  what, figures on stage, a named minority report, a one-line result. Zero extra calls.

**Examples**
- `examples/market-test-demo.md` — a product/pricing question judged by a panel of buyer
  personas minted with `--roles`, no new preset.
- `examples/self-review-v2.2.md` — the protocol judges this release with the new tiers.

### Changed

**Model tiers**
- "One apex model everywhere" → "one model family, tiers per role". Decomposer, Judge, Skeptic
  and the figures declare `model: opus`; Optimizer, Security, Maintainability-advocate,
  Resource-keeper and Champion declare `model: sonnet` in their frontmatter. Duel calls pass the
  tier explicitly (critic opus, champion sonnet). `--model <tier>` overrides for one run.
- `AUDIT_BLOCK` gains `tiers:`, `protagonist:`, `r2_participants:`.

**Cost**
- Early finalize is one Judge call: when nothing is disputed, Phase A and Phase B+C arrive in the
  same reply. Panel minimum is now a true 6 (the previous "6" omitted the second Judge call).
- Targeted R2 roster: only roles that disputed re-vote, plus Skeptic. Panel budget ~6-10 calls
  (typical 8) instead of ~6-11 (typical 11).

**Terminology**
- The first synthesis section is now headed `Verdict` (was `Consensus`) — the record documents
  a debate, not a merger. `CONSENSUS_STRENGTH` and `consensus_strength` are unchanged.

### Fixed
- Cost figures in README and SKILL.md now match the actual call structure.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

**The figures (deadlock-breakers)**
- 🕊 The outside-the-frame voice — a non-voting figure that dissolves a deadlock from above:
  exits the dispute's terms entirely and reports what the deadlock reveals, the view from
  outside, a `THE REFRAME:` line, and `Dissolves if:` conditions.
- 🔥 The transgressive voice — a non-voting figure that breaks a deadlock from below: names the
  one suppressed option nobody dared put on the table, why it's taboo, its honest price, and
  what it buys.
- Triggers — a `REFRAME:` cluster (≥2 roles on one thesis), theses marked `stagnated`, or a
  `Contested` verdict summon a figure automatically.
- `--summon above|below|both` — forces a figure regardless of trigger state.
- `--no-figures` — suppresses both figures even if a deadlock trigger fires.
- Cost: +1-2 calls, only on deadlock — never on a clean run.
- Tunable — as with every role in the protocol, the agent files are the source for the figures.

**REFRAME tag**
- Fifth rationale tag — any voter can raise `REFRAME:` to name the question behind the question
  when a thesis is mis-posed.
- Early-summon pipeline — ≥2 roles raising `REFRAME:` on the same thesis summons 🕊 the
  outside-the-frame voice early, and the reframe feeds the R2 re-vote (sensor → figure
  pipeline).

**Resource-keeper**
- The optional shelf's first role shipped as an actual agent file (opt-in via
  `--roles "+Resource-keeper"`) — the appreciative-inquiry counterweight to a panel of critics
  that is structurally careless about what already works. Must name at least one thing that
  must survive regardless of which side wins.

- `examples/self-review.md` — the protocol run on itself (panel mode + `--summon both`): the premise broken and reformulated, the FLIP contract firing in R2, a mid-run evidence correction, both figures speaking, and two product changes shipped as a result.

### Security

- Per-invocation egress confirmation before the Rung-1 external-critic CLI dispatch, naming the
  exact destination command and requiring explicit confirmation — not bypassable by
  `--with-external` (the flag forces the critic, not consent to a specific destination).
- Run-record sensitivity marker — a `README.txt` written into `./consensus-runs/` on first run,
  plus a `.gitignore` reminder when cwd is a git repository.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed (breaking)

- Renamed: repository `consensus-claude` → `psychodrama-protocol` (old GitHub URLs redirect);
  skill directory → `~/.claude/skills/psychodrama-protocol/`; agent files →
  `psychodrama-*.md`; slash command → `/psychodrama-protocol`. Migration from v1.x: remove old
  files (`rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/consensus-claude && rm ~/.claude/agents/consensus-claude-*.md`),
  then install fresh.

### Added

- "Why a psychodramatist built this" — the author section with the Moreno→mechanics mapping.
- 🪑 The empty chair — the feature name for the un-championed direction check.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

**Duel mode**
- `--mode` flag routes between `panel` (evaluate a formed decision) and `duels` (explore an
  open problem); triage asks the routing question up front when `--mode` isn't set.
- Tailored critics — each of the 3-5 strongest perspectives the Decomposer generates gets a
  Champion and an antagonist purpose-built for that specific idea, not a generic skeptic;
  critics stay FLIP-disciplined against strawmen. Each pair gets one isolated exchange.
- SURVIVAL grading — the Judge grades each duel on four levels (`clean` / `scarred` / `gutted`
  / `unproven`), feeding into the same `CONSENSUS_STRENGTH` line the panel uses.
- Champion's footnote — the Judge states in one sentence how the Champion would have answered
  its fatal flaw, fixing last-word bias at zero extra cost.
- Un-championed direction check — the Judge names the option nobody was minted to defend.
- FLIP-to-tripwire dividend — rejected perspectives' `FLIP:` tags invert into `Revisit if...`
  tripwires, same mechanism the panel already uses for disputed theses.

**Dialectic decomposition**
- Lumper/Splitter negotiation — decomposition now runs an internal negotiation over thesis
  grain (how finely to split the question), with structural separation between the two roles
  and a settlement that follows the stronger argument on a per-seam basis. Applies to both
  panel and duel mode.
- `GRAIN` trace line — an always-visible output line showing the negotiated framing, e.g.
  `GRAIN: 6 theses (Splitter proposed 7, Lumper proposed 6) — ...`; the full negotiation detail
  goes into the run record, not the trace line.
- `--grain fine|coarse` flag biases the negotiation toward more or fewer theses.
- Gate-tested on 4 diverse question types: grain tracked with question type (6/5/4/4 theses
  across the four types), settlements followed per-seam arguments rather than a fixed rule, and
  all four test runs spontaneously promoted a hidden premise to T0.

### Deprecated

- `--emergent` — now a deprecated alias for `--mode duels`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

**Reasoning depth**
- T0 Premise Distillation — the Decomposer now surfaces the question's foundational unstated
  premise as thesis T0, voted like any other thesis; a panel that disputes T0 is challenging
  the frame itself, and the synthesis leads with that.
- Structured vote tags — `FLIP:` (mandatory on every `DISPUTED` vote, names the evidence that
  would reverse it), `ANCHOR: "quote"` (grounds a vote in a specific piece of the question or
  context), and `[impact: critical|moderate|minor]`. The 4-status vocabulary is unchanged; the
  Judge weights disputes carrying `FLIP:` higher, flags unanchored votes, and prioritizes
  critical-impact conflicts.
- `CONSENSUS_STRENGTH` — the synthesis now opens with `Strong consensus` / `Working consensus`
  / `Narrowly carried` / `Contested`.
- Tripwires — the Prerequisites section now also lists `Revisit if: <observable event> →
  re-examine T<n>`, derived from `FLIP:` tags, turning the record into a living monitoring
  document instead of a one-time snapshot.
- Minority Report — a role that loses a vote by roughly 3:1 with substantive dissent gets a
  named block in Unresolved, tracked as a risk rather than buried as a footnote.

**Artifacts**
- `AUDIT_BLOCK` — every run record now opens with a machine-readable block (date, mode,
  roster, consensus strength, verdict, key assumptions), so the record can be pasted into any
  external model for a post-hoc audit, independent of which provider ran the panel.
- Decision journal — runs append one line (date, question, strength, verdict, link) to
  `./consensus-runs/INDEX.md`, turning accumulated runs into a browsable ledger.

**Run control**
- `--plan` flag — dry-run checkpoint that runs Triage and Decompose only, shows the parsed
  intent and theses, and waits for approval or edits before any panel votes are cast.
- `--roles` flag — one-run roster override: `+Shelf-role` enables a shelf role for this run
  only, `-Role` disables an active one, and `+name(focus:'...')` mints an ephemeral persona.

**Experimental**
- `--emergent` flag ("Schrödinger mode") — the problem defines its own panel: the Decomposer
  generates the 5-7 strongest distinct perspectives the question calls for, retroactively mints
  an ephemeral persona to champion each, then runs the normal per-thesis vote flow. Adversarial
  Presence is still enforced. Panel composition is non-deterministic by design — a deliberate
  novelty-vs-reproducibility trade, labeled experimental.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-19

- Provider-agnostic external critic — any CLI, or manual paste-through to whatever model you
  have — was gemini-only before.
- Agents inherit the current session's model — was hardcoded to `opus` before.
- Verifiable Decision Record written to `./consensus-runs/` on by default.
- Install block mkdir fix — `~/.claude/agents/` was never created, breaking first-time installs.
- Cost warning and "When to use this skill" section added.
- Uninstall/update docs added.
- Community files added: CONTRIBUTING.md, weak-verdict issue template.
- Affiliation disclaimer added.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-19

Initial public release.
