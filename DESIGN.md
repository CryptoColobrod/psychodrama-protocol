# The Psychodrama Protocol — Design

> **Renamed July 2026:** `consensus-claude` → `psychodrama-protocol`. This document doubles as the
> project's design log; historical references to the old name below are preserved as written.

A Claude Code skill: multi-perspective consensus via subagents with distinct roles. One model family, different system prompts, tiers per role. Runs within a Claude subscription (no extra API cost). Complements `consensus-protocol` (Claude+Gemini) — doesn't replace it.

## Purpose and boundaries

**What this is:** a cheap, fast multi-perspective review of architecture decisions, code, specs, and strategic choices — powered by a single apex model split across roles.

**What this is NOT:** not a replacement for `consensus-protocol`. They offer different value:
- `consensus-claude` — an internal sanity check, free within your subscription, single model → fast convergence.
- `consensus-protocol` — an external audit with a genuinely different model (Gemini), for cases where you need a **guaranteed** independent voice.

## Architecture decisions (made during brainstorming)

1. A single tool with auto-classification of the task (architecture | code | spec | strategy | other).
2. Classification happens without asking the user for confirmation, with manual override available after it's shown.
3. Panel size is adaptive (3–5 subagents) based on a complexity heuristic.
4. Round structure is hybrid: parallel R1 → judge finds disputes → R2 covers only disputed theses.
5. Anti-groupthink via a provider-agnostic external critic — an optional fallback for three specific cases, reached via a configured CLI or a manual paste-through handoff (see section 4).
6. Relationship to `consensus-protocol` — a separate new skill; the old one stays.
7. Debate mode is thesis-based (atomic theses T1..Tn with statuses AGREED/AGREED_WEAK/DISPUTED/NEEDS_CLARIFICATION), same as `consensus-protocol`.

## 1. Flow architecture

```
[User invokes /consensus-claude or the phrase "claude consensus"]
   ↓
[Main Opus] Classifies the task → selects a panel preset
   ↓
[Main Opus] Scores complexity → selects panel size (3-5)
   ↓
Prints: "Classified as: X · Panel: A / B / C / D (+Judge)"
(user can override via !preset / use:preset before R1)
   ↓
[Decomposer subagent] Cuts the task into atomic theses T1..Tn
   ↓
R1 in parallel: N subagents independently assign a status to each thesis
   ↓
[Judge subagent] Aggregates → agreement/dispute table
   ↓
[Anti-groupthink check] Does the external critic fallback trigger?
   ├─ yes → external critic (CLI or manual handoff) runs an independent check → its DISPUTED theses feed into R2
   └─ no → skip
   ↓
R2 in parallel: disputed theses only, agents see each other's R1 positions
   ↓
[Judge] Final synthesis: consensus + nuances + trade-offs + devil's advocate
   ↓
Output: chat summary (always) + ADR file (for arch/sec/infra)
```

**Principles:**
- One model family throughout; tiers per role (Decomposer/Judge/Skeptic/figures on Opus, voters on Sonnet), declared in agent frontmatter.
- R1 parallelism = isolation. Each subagent sees only: the original question + the list of theses + its own role mandate. It does not see other roles or their positions.
- The judge is a separate subagent — not the main Opus. Clean aggregation context.
- Hard cap: R1 + R2, never R3.

## 2. Role presets

Each role is a separate agent definition in `~/.claude/agents/consensus-claude-<role>.md` (standard Claude Code subagent pattern, following the same format as other agent definitions in `~/.claude/agents/`). **Important:** Claude Code only scans the top level of `~/.claude/agents/` — subdirectories are not supported. That's why all 10 files carry the `consensus-claude-` prefix, to avoid colliding with other agents.

| Task type | Base (4) | Cut (3, simple) | Add (5, complex) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `architecture` | Architect / Skeptic / Security / Pragmatist | drop Security | +Operations-SRE OR +Domain-expert |
| `code` | Optimizer / Skeptic / Security / Maintainability-advocate | drop Maintainability | +Performance-auditor |
| `spec` | Product-thinker / Architect / Skeptic / Scope-cutter | drop Scope-cutter | +User-advocate |
| `strategy` | Strategist / Skeptic / Customer-advocate / Pragmatist | drop Pragmatist | +Numbers-person |
| `other` | Architect / Skeptic / Pragmatist (3) | — | +ad-hoc role |

**Skeptic is present in every preset** — an anti-groupthink requirement.

**Style-reviewer** (originally in `code`) was replaced with **Maintainability-advocate** based on Gemini feedback: maintainability is broader than style and doesn't overlap with Optimizer.

### Mandate per role (key idea: orthogonal lens + mandatory disagreement)

| Role | Focus | Off-limits | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Architect | Structure, module boundaries, contracts, evolution | Don't speak to cost/security/UX | Find a point of disagreement with one panel member; prefer Pragmatist if present, otherwise anyone except Judge/Skeptic |
| Skeptic | Gaps, contradictions, unrealistic assumptions | — | Surface at least one weakness even on good decisions; if there truly is none, flag edge cases |
| Security | Threat model, attack surface, secrets, authn/authz, supply chain | Stay silent on performance | Find at least one attack vector |
| Pragmatist | What blows the deadline, what can be cut; enemy of over-engineering | Don't speak to code aesthetics | Find a point of disagreement with one panel member; prefer Architect if present, otherwise anyone except Judge/Skeptic |
| Optimizer | Correctness, readability, idiomaticity, simplifications | — | Find a point of disagreement with one panel member; prefer Maintainability-advocate if present, otherwise anyone except Judge/Skeptic |
| Maintainability-advocate | What makes code easy to maintain in 6 months; decomposition, naming, hidden dependencies | Don't duplicate style conventions | Find what will complicate future changes |
| Product-thinker | Whether the feature is needed at all, what pain it solves, who the user is | Don't drift into implementation | Question whether the task should exist |
| Scope-cutter | What to cut from the spec, where the MVP line is | Don't critique architecture | Name at least 1 item to cut |
| Strategist | Market positioning, priorities, success criteria | Don't drift into tactics | Find a point of disagreement with one panel member; prefer Customer-advocate if present, otherwise anyone except Judge/Skeptic |
| Customer-advocate | The voice of the user/customer, what actually hurts | Don't speak to unit economics | Name at least 1 frustration |
| Numbers-person | Unit economics, capacity, concrete figures | Don't speak to vision | Request a missing figure |
| Operations-SRE | Monitoring, failure modes, operability, postmortems | Don't speak to feature scope | Find at least 1 operational risk |
| Domain-expert | Technical depth on a specific topic (chosen ad-hoc) | — | Accepts `--domain-context "Kafka, Postgres 14"` via flag |
| **Judge** | Aggregation, synthesis, trade-offs, devil's advocate | Don't introduce new theses | Must write a "what could go wrong" section; must handle directional theses (criterion-style theses with an implicit direction, not just binary AGREE/DISAGREE) |
| **Decomposer** | Cuts the source task into atomic theses T1..Tn before R1 | Don't evaluate theses; don't propose solutions — decomposition only | Every thesis must be independently AGREEable/DISPUTEable; avoid compound statements; target 3–7 theses for a typical task |

**Why Decomposer is a separate subagent rather than inline in the main Opus.** The quality of the whole process hinges critically on decomposition quality (a foundational vulnerability flagged by Gemini review). A separate subagent with a clean context and a strict single-purpose mandate produces better decomposition than the main Opus, which is holding the entire process in its head. Same logic for the Judge — splitting it into its own subagent is a structural safeguard against role bleed.

## 3. Classification and complexity heuristics

### Classification (cascade, first match wins):

1. Explicit preset in the input (`/consensus-claude --preset architecture`).
2. **Artifact signals:**
   - a diff/patch/code appears in the message → `code`
   - `*-design.md`, `*-plan.md`, `*-spec.md` mentioned or shown → `spec`
   - an ADR or a mention of choosing a database/infra/protocol → `architecture`
   - pricing/marketing/business model/features → `strategy`
3. **Keywords in the phrasing:** "architecture", "choose a database", "trade-off" → `architecture`; "review", "check this code", "PR", "optimize" → `code`; "spec", "plan", "brainstorm" → `spec`; "priority", "positioning", "pricing tier" → `strategy`.
4. **Fallback** → `other`.

The first output line is always: `Classified as: architecture · Complexity 4/5 · Panel: Architect / Skeptic / Security / Pragmatist / Operations-SRE (+Judge)`.

**Manual override:** the user can override the classification in a single line **before R1 starts**: `!preset code`, `use:spec`, `--preset strategy`. Once R1 has started it's too late — you have to restart.

### Adaptive size (signal counter):

| Signal | +1 |
|---|---|
| Mentions security / auth / secrets / PII | ✓ |
| Mentions scaling / capacity / latency | ✓ |
| ≥3 atomic theses after decomposition | ✓ |
| Explicit trade-off with multiple options (≥2) | ✓ |
| Domain-specific (database engine, distributed systems, ML) | ✓ |

| Score | Size |
|---|---|
| 0–1 | **3** (cut) |
| 2–3 | **4** (base) |
| 4–5 | **5** (add) |

## 4. Anti-groupthink (layered defense)

The single-model echo chamber is the **main irreducible risk.** It can't be fully eliminated, but it's mitigated by six layers:

**Layer 1 — R1 isolation.** Each subagent in R1 sees only the original question + theses + its own mandate. It doesn't see other roles or their answers. Enforced by the `Agent` tool (each subagent runs in a clean context).

**Layer 2 — Mandatory disagreement (dynamic, structured).** Every role is instructed: "find a point of disagreement with one panel member; prefer <specific role>; if absent, anyone except Judge/Skeptic." The dynamic phrasing survives panel cuts. This isn't passive criticism — it's an active search for contradictions.

**Disagreement output format — a machine-parseable block** (validated in PoC 0.2):
```
DISAGREEMENT:
TARGET: <role name>
THESIS: T<n>
COUNTER: <1–2 sentences citing a concrete mechanism — coupling/missing risk/unproven abstraction, not a slogan>
```
If there truly is no disagreement, the fallback is `COUNTER: NO_DISAGREEMENT — T<n> is robust because: (1) <criterion>, (2) <criterion>, (3) <criterion>` (an escape hatch of last resort).

Pragmatist was given an **operational definition of over-engineering**: "an abstraction is over-engineered if its specific need hasn't materialized ≥2 times in real code/incidents." This turns YAGNI slogans into auditable claims.

**Layer 3 — Skeptic must deliver.** Skeptic can never return "everything's fine." At minimum, one weakness or a set of named edge cases.

**Layer 4 — Devil's advocate section from the Judge.** The final report always includes a "What could go wrong" section — 1–2 strong arguments against the resulting consensus.

**Layer 5 — external critic fallback.** Triggers if **any one** of these holds:
- All theses are AGREED **or** AGREED_WEAK after R1 (100% "weak or strong" agreement is a groupthink red flag, per Gemini review feedback).
- Task type is `architecture` OR the task mentions security/PII.
- Explicit `--with-external` flag.

If the critic fires and returns DISPUTED theses, those theses automatically enter R2 — even if the Opus agents were unanimous.

**Implementation — provider-agnostic, via a CLI-or-manual ladder (not MCP).** Originally built and PoC-validated (PoC 0.3) against the Gemini CLI specifically — `timeout 30s gemini -p "<prompt>" 2>/dev/null` via the Bash tool — for reasons that still hold as the default worked example:
- **Cheaper** — OAuth via a Google AI subscription plan, not per-call API billing. Both resources (the Claude subscription and the Google AI subscription) run on a flat-rate model.
- **Newer model** — `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (the CLI default) vs. `gemini-2.5-pro` in the MCP path.
- **Less overhead** — no auto-save to a reviews directory, which an internal fallback doesn't need.

The mechanism has since been generalized into a 3-step ladder so the fallback isn't hardwired to one provider:
1. **Configured CLI (any provider).** The Protocol block's one configurable command line (default `gemini -p`) is invoked the same way as above — any CLI that accepts a prompt and prints text qualifies (`codex exec`, `ollama run <model>`, etc.), not only `gemini`.
2. **Manual handoff.** If no command is configured, or the CLI exits non-zero — the orchestrator prints the critic prompt to the user with instructions to paste it into any other model (web chat included) and paste the reply back. This makes the tripwire dependency-free: no CLI install required at all.
3. **Skip.** The user declines → `skipped (user_declined)`, run continues.

Prompt template (shared by both the CLI path and the manual path):
```
You are an external critic. For each thesis below, return ONE line in format:
T<n>: <AGREED|AGREED_WEAK|DISPUTED|NEEDS_CLARIFICATION> [<comment if not AGREED>]

Theses:
T1: ...
T2: ...
```

Response parsing is a regex over the statuses, applied identically to CLI stdout and to a pasted manual reply. **Inside `consensus-claude`, all external-critic calls go through the CLI-or-manual ladder only.** The MCP tools (`mcp__gemini-tools__*`) are not used by this skill.

**Layer 6 — Trade-offs in the final output.** The Judge must explicitly spell out key trade-offs: "T2 — Architect chose extensibility, Pragmatist flagged a +2 week schedule risk. Architect's call was adopted, risk acknowledged." This prevents quietly burying the losing side of an argument.

**Known limitations (stated explicitly):**
- The `Agent` tool in Claude Code doesn't let you vary temperature per subagent → one classic anti-groupthink technique is unavailable.
- Every agent is from the same model family → shared blind spots can't be fully ruled out. The external critic fallback closes this gap partially, not completely.

## 5. Stop conditions and stagnation

Priority, top to bottom:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| After R1: all AGREED/AGREED_WEAK + external critic fallback didn't trigger OR the critic also agrees | **Early finalize**, skip R2 |
| After R1: all AGREED/AGREED_WEAK, but the external critic surfaced DISPUTED theses | R2 runs **only** on the theses the critic disputed |
| After R1: some theses are DISPUTED/NEEDS_CLARIFICATION | R2 runs on those theses |
| After R2: all AGREED/AGREED_WEAK | **Finalize.** AGREED_WEAK nuances → "Nuances to consider" |
| After R2: some theses still DISPUTED | **Finalize with a flag.** "Unresolved" → its own section, arguments from both sides, escalate to the user |

**Stagnation in R2:** if a thesis's agent arguments just repeat R1's arguments with no new substantive information (detected by the Judge via semantic overlap), that's stagnation. The Judge does not run another round — it marks the thesis "stagnated" and escalates to the user.

**Hard cap:** R1 + R2 maximum. We do not attempt R3.

**Rationale for the hard cap:** if a single-model panel hasn't converged after two rounds, that's a signal to pursue **external** review via `consensus-protocol` — not to repeat the same panel again.

### Edge cases

- **The task doesn't decompose into atomic theses** (e.g., "what do you think of this code?") → fall back to *single-thesis* mode: the whole task becomes one thesis T1, the panel responds freely, and the Judge aggregates. Less valuable, but doesn't break.
- **A subagent returns garbage or an invalid status** → the Judge marks that vote `invalid`; the thesis is scored on N-1 votes. If invalid votes exceed 50%, abort and notify the user.
- **Configured CLI is unavailable** (non-zero exit, expired OAuth token, binary not found, timeout, or no command configured at all) → fall through to the manual paste-through handoff instead of failing outright (see DESIGN.md · Layer 5); only if the user also declines the manual handoff does the fallback report `skipped (user_declined)`. (Originally, in the Gemini-only PoC, exit code 42 was treated as a special "invalid input" case; the generalized ladder folds that into "any non-zero exit → offer the manual handoff," since the specific exit code is a Gemini CLI quirk, not a general CLI contract.)
- **Cross-language quirk** (PoC 0.3): Russian input → Gemini returns English output with the correct T<n>: STATUS format. This is a feature for anti-groupthink purposes (a different language is a different angle), but if the final output needs comments in the user's language, the Judge must translate them during synthesis.

## 7. Triggers and integration

### Slash command

```
/consensus-claude <question>
/consensus-claude --with-external <question>
/consensus-claude --domain-context "Kafka, Postgres 14" <question>
/consensus-claude --preset code <question>
```

### Phrase triggers

| Phrase | Skill |
|---|---|
| "claude consensus", "consensus claude" | **`consensus-claude`** |
| "gemini consensus", "consensus with Gemini", "debate this with Gemini" | **`consensus-protocol`** |
| "need a consensus" (no model specified) | **Ask for clarification:** "claude or gemini?" |

**Auto-launch (Claude deciding on its own) is NOT supported.** The skill only starts on an explicit trigger phrase or slash command. This is a deliberate user-control choice — every trigger is explicit.

The phrase mapping lives in the user's global Claude Code configuration, in the "Gemini — phrase-to-tool mapping" section. The existing entry for `consensus-protocol` stays; an entry for `consensus-claude` is added alongside it.

### Integration with other skills

- `superpowers:brainstorming`, after producing a spec, **may suggest** running `/consensus-claude --preset spec` as a self-review step (an alternative to the existing gemini_review path). The user decides.
- `superpowers:writing-plans` — same pattern.
- `superpowers:requesting-code-review` — same pattern, `--preset code`.

Integration means a suggestion, never an auto-launch.

## Open questions for implementation

(These go into writing-plans; they don't block the design.)

1. How does the Judge detect semantic overlap between R1/R2 arguments for stagnation — a keyword heuristic, or an additional LLM pass?
2. Final prompt-template wording for the Decomposer, the Judge, and each role (worked out in PoC).
3. MVP priority: which preset to start with (Gemini's recommendation — `code`, as the most frequent use case).
4. **Phase 0 (PoC before full implementation):**
   - **PoC-Decomposer:** test decomposition quality on 5–10 real historical tasks (architecture/code-review/specs). Metric: theses are atomic, non-overlapping, and cover the task.
   - **PoC-Disagreement:** with a pair of roles (Architect + Pragmatist), verify that dynamic mandatory disagreement produces a substantive debate, not a formality.
   - **PoC-CLI-fallback:** verify that `gemini -p` reliably returns parseable per-thesis statuses.

## Prior art (for context)

- [agent-review-panel](https://github.com/wan-huiyan/agent-review-panel) — 4–6 reviewers + a supreme judge, anti-groupthink.
- [adversarial-review (ng)](https://github.com/ng/adversarial-review) — Optimizer + Skeptic pairs.
- [adversarial-spec (zscole)](https://github.com/zscole/adversarial-spec) — multi-model (GPT/Gemini/Grok), not a fit here.
- The existing `~/.claude/skills/consensus-protocol/SKILL.md` — the source of the thesis-based protocol and the ADR format.

## Future Arc (v2+ roadmap)

Freezing scope to a single preset (`code`) is a deliberate choice, not an unfinished state. v1 ships a spike: narrow, deep, and carried through to completion — a small, complete solution rather than a scaffold with half-built rooms. Elegance here comes from completeness, not coverage. The section below exists to show the boundary was drawn on purpose, with a clear view of what's beyond it: the orchestration and resilience layer gets built next, in public (build-in-public), not quietly and not because "there wasn't time."

Every item below is tagged with why it's v2 and not v1 — a deliberate-debt signal, not forgotten work.

1. **A full dynamic role library.** Metadata for `when_to_enable` / `pairs_well_with` / `conflicts_with` on every role, plus auto-assembly of the optimal panel for a given request (tailored to its specifics, not just its task type). Why not v1: this requires reliably scoring how relevant a role is to a given phrasing — there isn't enough data from a single preset to calibrate that heuristic without risking an incoherent panel. v1 ships a fixed golden standard (4 roles) plus a static shelf (see Role Library below) that the user edits by hand.

2. **Automated relevance-weighting by competencies.** In v1, the Judge weighs votes through its own reasoning (see Out-of-lens in the Protocol) — it works, but it's opaque and not reproducible across runs. Automating the down-weighting of low-relevance roles (e.g. by matching a role's `competencies` against a thesis's keywords) is v2 work, once there's a corpus of real votes to calibrate the weights against.

3. **A SCOPE.md triage agent.** In v1, triage is the orchestrator reading the Scope section directly out of the Protocol block — it works, but conflates the orchestrator and gatekeeper roles. A dedicated triage agent backed by an extensible `SCOPE.md` (a growing list of in/out patterns that doesn't require editing prompts) is v1.1 — the next step after release, not a full v2.

4. **ANTIBODIES.md.** A declarative list of the skill's own known failure modes — e.g. "trivial decomposition into >7 theses," "groupthink with weak rationales" — injected into the Judge as immune memory during synthesis. This is a category-correct way to "learn" from its own mistakes without writing a line of code: the file grows as real runs surface new findings, and the Judge reads it as a checklist of known failure modes. It's a hallmark of a mature v2 system — v1 captures these lessons as prose in the Post-Phase retrospective (below); ANTIBODIES.md turns that experience into a structured artifact the Judge can actually parse.

5. **The remaining presets (architecture / spec / strategy / other) + auto-classification + adaptive panel sizing 3–5.** Fully designed already (see §2 "Role presets" and §3 "Classification and complexity heuristics" above) — this is an extension of an already-accepted architecture, not a new one. Deliberately excluded from v1: v1 stays frozen on the `code` preset so one panel reaches production quality, instead of five panels reaching mediocre quality. Turning this on is a matter of copying an already-proven pattern onto new roles, not a redesign.

## Role Library (v1: golden standard + optional shelf)

In v1, the panel is assembled in a way that's category-correct for a markdown skill: roles are agent-definition files, not config entries. Enabling or disabling a role means adding or removing it from the roster in the Protocol block of SKILL.md — by editing text, not through a config loader or a runtime flag. This is a deliberate form, not a scaled-down stand-in for a "real" config system — for a markdown-native skill, an editable role list *is* the native way to manage panel composition.

**Golden standard (active by default).** The roster from §2/Protocol: `Optimizer`, `Skeptic`, `Security`, `Maintainability-advocate`. This is the default `code`-preset panel described above — its mandate table isn't repeated here (see §2), only its place in the overall library: 4 roles covering correctness, adversarial pressure, security, and future maintainability — a curated minimum, not a random sample.

**Optional shelf (OFF by default).** Enabled manually, by moving a role from the shelf into the active roster:

| Role | Mandate (1 line) | when_to_enable | conflicts_with |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Performance-hawk` | Latency, throughput, resource consumption | Perf-critical / real-time code | `Simplicity-advocate` |
| `Product-thinker` | User value, JTBD, why this should exist at all | Product and spec decisions | — |
| `Scope-cutter` | Trims the excess from MVP, names what to cut | Risk of over-build, scope creep | — (an adversarial role — can satisfy the Adversarial Presence invariant in place of Skeptic) |
| `Simplicity-advocate` | Any complexity beyond what the value requires is a bug | Author/panel prone to over-engineering | `Performance-hawk` |
| `Domain-expert` | A pluggable domain lens (see `--domain-context` in §2) | A narrow, specialized domain | — |
| `Resource-keeper` | Guards working assets; must name at least one thing that must survive regardless of which side wins | Panel is critic-heavy, risk of discarding a working asset | — (an appreciative-inquiry counterweight, not adversarial — does not satisfy the Adversarial Presence invariant) |

**`Resource-keeper` (shipped in v2.1.0).** The shelf's first role to move from concept to an actual agent file — opt-in via `--roles "+Resource-keeper"`, off by default like the rest of the shelf. Where the golden standard and the rest of the shelf are built to find fault, Resource-keeper's mandate is structurally inverted: every other role's silence on what already works is a blind spot the panel doesn't self-correct for, so Resource-keeper exists specifically to name what must survive the vote regardless of outcome.

**`Champion` (shipped in v2.2.0).** A conditional voice, neither golden standard nor shelf: it enters only when a Protagonist position is staged (`--position`, or the Triage offer). Mandate is advocacy in the standard vote format plus a mandatory `WEAK_POINT:`; it is non-adversarial and does not count toward Size. This closes the protagonist element of the stage metaphor without touching the panel's constitution.

**Panel invariants** (defined in Protocol · Panel invariants, repeated here for convenience when picking from the shelf):
- **Adversarial Presence** — the active panel must include ≥1 adversarial role; the default is `Skeptic`, but `Security` and `Scope-cutter` also qualify.
- **Size** — 3–7 active roles.
- **No redundancy** — don't enable roles with conflicting mandates at the same time (see the `conflicts_with` column above; e.g. `Performance-hawk` + `Simplicity-advocate` is a direct conflict of priorities, not complementary lenses).

**How to enable one (v1, honest).** Open the Protocol block in SKILL.md, find the Roster section, add the role's name from the shelf to the active list for the relevant preset (or create a panel override). There's no runtime loader, config flags, or role-picker UI — this is a markdown skill, and editing the list as text is the extension seam. To be explicit: what looks like "a missing feature" is in fact v1's architectural extension point.

Deliberate-debt signal: most shelf roles being off by default is curation, not an oversight. An empty or unstructured shelf would suggest the author never thought about extensibility. A shelf with `when_to_enable`/`conflicts_with` metadata on every role shows the opposite: extensibility was designed in, just not forced on as default complexity.

## Known limitations (stated explicitly)

- **Single-model echo chamber.** Every agent is from the same model family. The external critic fallback layer closes this gap partially, not completely. This is a deliberate trade-off in exchange for cost and speed.
- **Fragile classification.** The cascade heuristic can misfire. Manual override is mandatory. We're not attempting an ML classifier.
- **Prompt quality = system quality.** 90% of success comes down to the wording of each role's mandate. Requires iterative tuning.
- **No temperature variation.** A technical limitation of the Claude Code Agent tool.

## Post-Phase 1 retrospective (2026-05-22)

**Phase 0 PoC surprises:**
- The Decomposer's initial prompt from PLAN.md failed on binary "A or B" questions — it produced mirror pairs like `T1: choose A / T2: choose B`. Fixed via a criteria-based decomposition rule (3 iterations, up to 10/10).
- Pragmatist initially slid into YAGNI slogans. Fixed via an operational definition: "over-engineered = a specific need hasn't materialized ≥2 times in code/incidents."
- The structured `DISAGREEMENT: TARGET/THESIS/COUNTER` block (validated in PoC 0.2) is machine-parseable and outperforms prose-style disagreement. This structure made it into the production prompts for Optimizer and Maintainability-advocate.
- Gemini CLI cross-language behavior: input in one language → output in English. Initially looked like a bug, turned out to be a feature (a different language is a different angle) — the Judge translates during synthesis.
- Gemini exit code 42 on empty input isn't documented anywhere, but it's detectable as a distinctive sentinel.

**Phase 1 implementation surprises:**
- Subagents must live at the **top level** of `~/.claude/agents/` — subdirectories (`~/.claude/agents/consensus-claude/`) aren't scanned. Solved with a filename prefix. PLAN.md originally had the wrong path — fixed after the fact.
- The list of available subagent_type values is cached at the start of a Claude Code session. New agent files aren't visible until restart. End-to-end smoke testing is deferred to a new session.

**What to watch in Phase 2 (when expanding presets):**
- Skeptic in production might turn out too formulaic — watch for it churning out boilerplate "edge cases: empty input + concurrent write" answers.
- Cross-role mandatory disagreement priority: in `architecture/cut` (3 agents), when Security is dropped, the dynamic fallback looks for disagreement from Pragmatist/Architect instead — already validated in PoC, but watch real runs to make sure this doesn't turn into circular criticism.
- Strategy preset (Phase 2): Gemini Set 2 (criteria-style strategy) returned all NEEDS_CLARIFICATION — which is correct behavior, but the Judge needs to parse this as "insufficient data" and escalate to the user, not flag it as groupthink.
- ADR auto-generation for the `architecture` preset — the path format `docs/decisions/` is already defined, but projects use different conventions (`documentation/decisions/`, `docs/adr/`) — needs a heuristic to detect the existing structure before writing a new ADR.
